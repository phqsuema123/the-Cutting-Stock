## Overview

The Cutting Stock Problem is a classic optimization conundrum found in operations research and mathematics. Essentially, it involves efficiently cutting raw materials, such as rolls of paper, steel rods, or wood, into smaller pieces to meet specific demands while minimizing waste. To tackle this challenge, we'll be employing the Knapsack Algorithm, a well-known optimization technique.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to leverage the Knapsack Algorithm to address various types of Cutting Stock Problems (CSP). By doing so, we aim to find optimal cutting patterns that minimize waste and fulfill demand requirements.

### Types of CSP

1. **One-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (1D CSP):**
   - This pertains to cutting single-dimensional materials like wood or metal into smaller pieces.

2. **Two-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (2D CSP):**
   - Involves cutting two-dimensional materials such as cloth or paper efficiently.

3. **Three-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (3D CSP):**
   - Pertains to cutting three-dimensional materials, like boxes or materials with complex shapes, optimally.

### Tools Used
To implement and execute this project, we'll utilize the following tools:

- **VS Code:** A popular integrated development environment.
- **Python v3:** Programming language used for algorithm implementation.
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework for building web applications.
