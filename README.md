# Project Outline: Solving the Cutting Stock Problem using the Knapsack Algorithm

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply the Knapsack Algorithm to solve various types of Cutting Stock Problems (CSP).

### Types of CSP

1. **One-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (1D CSP):**
   - Involves cutting single-dimensional materials like wood or metal.

2. **Two-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (2D CSP):**
   - Involves cutting two-dimensional materials such as cloth or paper.

3. **Three-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (3D CSP):**
   - Involves cutting three-dimensional materials, like boxes or materials with complex shapes.
