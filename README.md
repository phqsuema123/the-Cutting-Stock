# Project Outline: Solving the Cutting Stock Problem using the Knapsack Algorithm

## Overview


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply the Knapsack Algorithm to solve various types of Cutting Stock Problems (CSP).

### what is cutting stock problem?

The Cutting Stock Problem is a classic optimization problem in operations research and mathematics. It involves cutting raw materials, such as rolls of paper, steel rods, or wood, into smaller pieces to fulfill a set of demands while minimizing waste. The goal is to find the most efficient way to cut the raw material to meet the demand.

### Types of CSP

1. **One-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (1D CSP):**
   - Involves cutting single-dimensional materials like wood or metal.

2. **Two-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (2D CSP):**
   - Involves cutting two-dimensional materials such as cloth or paper.

3. **Three-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (3D CSP):**
   - Involves cutting three-dimensional materials, like boxes or materials with complex shapes.
